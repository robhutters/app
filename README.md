# README

I'm a self-taught developer. This repo contains the front-end code for a recipe app. I designed it for people with sensory issues and eventually want to include everything necessary for it to be super accessible to everyone. I'm building it for a Dutch market. I intend to collect and sell user data to other businesses and offer premium features to consumers.

## Tech stack

Postgres backend (Supabase / Functions)
React (TypeScript) front-end (Vite)
Netlify (host / CD / CI )

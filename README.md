# Background

Every front-end application needs basic features like logging in, account management, and a dashboard with user-centric features; I was building my next app with that idea in mind. It has morphed into a recipe app.

# de luie chef 

Translation: "the lazy chef"
Idea: build a Tinder-like recipe app. 
Business: collect and sell user data, offer premium features to consumers.

# How I work

I open an Issue ticket on Github with the feature I want to develop. I make a judgement call on the spot whether this feature is necessary for an MVP. 

I work with 3 windows open: Safari (GitHub, e-mail, ChatGPT), FireFox (documentation, research, database, app), VSCODE (code, terminal). This setup keeps me focused on what matters most.

When I design a new component I ask ChatGPT for help with the process.

I try to tackle one feature a day (10 minutes to 3 hours), but usually exceed that number.

I try to tackle two bugs a day if there are any reported. 

I do not work more than four hours a day because productivity plummets beyond that window. I can think about the project while doing other life stuff. That's how it should be for everyone. 

# Hosted on Netlify 

I have 3 branches, testing, staging, and production. Each branch gets its own deploy on Netlify with their own unique URL.

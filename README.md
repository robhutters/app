# README

I'm a self-taught developer. This repo contains the front-end code for a Tinder-like recipe app. I'm building it for a Dutch market. It's called "the lazy chef". I intend to collect and sell user data to other businesses and offer premium features to consumers.

## How I work

I open an ticket on a Github kanban project board with the feature I want to develop. I make a judgement call on the spot whether this feature is necessary for an MVP. 

I work with 3 windows open: Safari (GitHub, e-mail, ChatGPT), FireFox (documentation, research, database, app), VSCODE (code, terminal). This setup keeps me focused on what matters most.

When I design a new component I ask ChatGPT for help with the process.

I try to tackle one feature a day (10 minutes to 3 hours), but usually exceed that number.

I try to tackle two bugs a day if there are any reported. 

I do not work more than four hours a day because productivity plummets beyond that window. I think about the project while doing other life stuff.
